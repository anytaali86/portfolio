Hello! I am Anyta Ali; a self-motivated designer, currently enrolled in Full Stack Web Developer Certification Program with SMU (and loving it). The Ultimate goal of this journey is to become a full-Stack Developer.

I'm based in Dallas, but originally hail from a tiny town in Pakistan.

I especially enjoy understanding user behavior and being able to take that information to design delightful experiences. Passionately interested in the immense potential of mobile, and some of the possibilities with the platform.

Aside from all this I live to travel, I dig abstract art and passioante about cosmetic formulation. I care deeply about equality and animal liberation.

Stack used for this project: HTML, CSS
